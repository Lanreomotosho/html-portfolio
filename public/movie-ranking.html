<hr />
<h3>Aníkúlápó: Rise of the Spectre</h3>
<p>Saro (Kunle Remi) grappling with his newfound immortality and the heartbreaking loss of Arolake (Bimbo Ademoye). <br />
    But hold on tight, because things are about to get even wilder. <br />

    where he uncovers ancient secrets, encounters otherworldly beings,  <br />
    and faces a destiny he could never have imagined. Along the way, <br />

<h3>Adire </h3>
<p>Kehinde Bankole shines as Adire, a former sex worker turned entrepreneur, <br />
    who shakes up a small town with her lingerie business. <br />
    It's a feel-good story about female empowerment, self-discovery, <br />
    and challenging societal norms. Plus, the fashion in this film is on point.</p>
<h3>Ijakumo: The Born Again Stripper</h3>
<p>Hold onto your hats, folks, because this Nollywood movie is a wild ride of passion, <br />
    betrayal, and redemption. It's a captivating look at the age-old struggle between temptation and faith, <br />
    asking the question: Can a leopard truly change its spots? <br />
    Toyin Abraham is captivating as the exotic dancer caught in a  <br />
    whirlwind romance with a pastor harbouring a scandalous secret.</p>
